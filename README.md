# MicroModulator

MicroModulator is a plugin for Musescore that allows the use of microtones. It efficiently adjusts the pitch of each note (whether in a selection or the entire score) based on its accidental. This plugin is designed to work seamlessly with Musescore version 4.X. To install MicroModulator, just copy the project folder into `Documents/MuseScore4/Plugins`.

_A demonstration file, showcasing all the accidentals in action, can be found at `resources/Demonstration.mscz`. Feel free to explore this file to see the functionality of the plugin in action._
